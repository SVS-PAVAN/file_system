Hey! people nice to meet you all

This is my repo which contains the implemetation of In-Memory File System

In this you can find file_system.cpp

You can run that file using the command
g++ file_system.cpp

And now an output file named a.out is generated and then use the command
./a.out to run the program

Requirements:

Gcc Compiler with g++
